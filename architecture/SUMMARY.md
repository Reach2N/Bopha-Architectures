## üí° Tips for Success

### Viewing Diagrams

- **Mermaid**: Open on GitHub (auto-renders) or use VS Code extension
- **PlantUML**: Use VS Code extension or online PlantText editor
- **Markdown**: GitHub renders beautifully with tables and formatting

### Updating Diagrams

- **Small changes**: Edit directly in GitHub web UI
- **Large changes**: Clone repo, edit locally, preview in VS Code
- **Always**: Commit with descriptive message ("Update Week 2 status")

### Exporting for Presentations

```bash
# Generate SVGs from PlantUML
cd architecture/diagrams/plantuml/
plantuml -tsvg *.puml
mv *.svg ../exports/

# Take screenshots from GitHub for Mermaid
# (High quality, dark/light mode available)
```
